SYNOPSIS

		LychrelNumber [ options ]


DESCRIPTION

		The lychrel number finder finds possible lychrel numbers between 0 and
		the given maximum number. Since you cannot say that a number is a
		lychrel number this program makes the given number of iterations to find
		a palindrome. If after the maximum number of iterations no palindrome
		has been found this program says that the current number is a possible
		lychrel number.
		But of course it could be possible that after some more iterations you
		would find out that this number wasn't a lychrel number.
		But that's the problem.
		
		All possible numbers will be printed on screen.


OPTIONS

		The following options are supported:

		-help
			Shows this help.

		-iterations n
			Defines that after maximum n iterations the number is a possible
			lychrel number. If this option isn't defined the maximum number of
			iterations will be 1000.

		-max-number n
			Defines that the program should test n numbers. If this option isn't
			given the maximum number to test will be 1000.
